## Basic MVC API structure

We are using nodemon package to reload the API every time some code is changed.

### Models

The model is the layer responsible for the access to the data, for the validation and consistency of them. Should be used within controllers.

### Controllers

The controller will be responsible for handling the request and will be delivering a response to the user.

### View

The view in this project will be the routes, that will be using the controllers.

### Folders

See the folder structure
